Known Bugs 12/11/18:
 - EnemyBasic is invisible
 - Need to manually add and set up AppleJavaExtensions and Jamepad libraries (in libraries folder)
 - Screen maximization on macOS is buggy and the game is cut off (you can go off the screen)

Event Process/How the game runs:
 - Game.java acts as a holder class for all the games data
         - This was kept from older version, but those properties should be shifted to a less functional class. 
         
 - Game.java creates the window.java, and passes itself to it... Window then adds game to its JFrame 
 - Game.java operates the entire programs ticks and rendering
         - Critical that handler is ticks and rendered every cycle. 

 - All Enemies and entities in the game are added to handler.java's list of GameObject.... handler.java renders everything
   From here. Nice because all rendering for enemies is kept in one area. Remember this class draws objects using Game.javas Graphic
   object.
   
 - GamemodeManager.java is a mini version of Game.java... ticks and renders the correct gamemode according to the current Mode property
   in the class. Again, uses Game.java's Graphic object...
   
 - Waves is a gamemode, and outlines and generates enemies to be passed to the level class. 
 
 - Level class is an "outline" of a round or level for Waves... or any gamemode. It allows the programmer to add more game mode without
   having to repeatively re-program enemy spawning logic. Some logic is inherited from the gameMode that is passed to the level class.
